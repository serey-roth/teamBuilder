## Team Builder
A basic web application that allows users to add, edit and delete team members. Implemented CRUD operations.

Each team member has a name and a gender (more infomation will be added in later updates).

## Tools
I compartmentalized script files into modules for better readability as well as easier modifications in later updates. I used Sass to write the styling since I've wanted to practice my skills with the tool.
